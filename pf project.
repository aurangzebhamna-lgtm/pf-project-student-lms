The Student Result Management System is a console-based C++ application developed to 
manage student academic records efficiently. 
It allows users to add, update, search, delete, and store student data, calculate results 
automatically, and generate class reports. 
This project demonstrates the practical use of structures, arrays, file handling, functions, 
and control statements in C++.
